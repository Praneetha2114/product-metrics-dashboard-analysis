# Product Metrics & Dashboard Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding core product metrics using a sample user activity dataset. The goal is to analyze how users interact with a product over time and to derive basic insights using simple analytical methods and dashboards.

This project is designed as an entry-level product analytics exercise and does not rely on advanced coding.

## Objectives
- Understand and calculate key product metrics
- Analyze user activity patterns
- Create simple dashboards for decision support
- Practice explaining insights in clear, business-friendly language

## Key Metrics Covered
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- User Retention
- Conversion (Signup to Purchase)

## Dataset
The dataset contains simulated user activity data with the following fields:
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user
- `signup_date`: Date when the user signed up
- `activity_date`: Date of user activity
- `action`: Type of action performed (signup, login, purchase)

File location:
data/sample_user_data.csv


## Analysis Approach
- Loaded the dataset into Excel
- Cleaned and formatted date fields
- Calculated DAU and MAU using pivot tables
- Analyzed repeat activity to understand retention
- Identified conversion from signup to purchase
- Created simple charts to visualize trends

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub

## Key Learnings
- How product metrics reflect user engagement
- How to structure data for analysis
- How to communicate insights clearly using dashboards
- Importance of retention and conversion in product decision-making

## Next Steps
- Improve the dataset with more users and time periods
- Add cohort-based retention analysis
- Enhance dashboards with additional insights
